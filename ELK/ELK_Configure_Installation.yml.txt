## The following is my steps and proof in Configuring ELK with Docker
## The ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana) can be installed on 
## a variety of different operating systems and in various different setups.
## While the most common installation setup is Linux and other Unix-based systems,
## a less-discussed scenario is using Docker.

## One of the reasons for this could be a contradiction between what is required
## from a data pipeline architecture — persistence, robustness, security — and the ephemeral and distributed nature of Docker.
## Having said that, and as demonstrated in the instructions below 
## Docker can be an extremely easy way to set up the stack.
