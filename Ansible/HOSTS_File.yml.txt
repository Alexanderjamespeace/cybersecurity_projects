# Below I have included my default Ansible file for our Hosts.
# I have also included extensive details and examples for reference.
#
# Our Ansible Host's file may be accessed in /etc/ansible/hosts
# Here are 5. factors to keep in mind:
#   1. Comments here share a '#' character to the left
#   
#   2. Spaces such as the previous one are ignored
#   3. Specific sets of hosts include the delimitor [header] in their elements
#   4. By entering ip addresses or the specified Host name one can effectively find them
#   5. A IP address(s) and Hosts can be effectively exist as members of multiple groups/sets

# To show an examples of ungrouped hosts, specify before any group headers.

##
## 192.168.100.10
## blue.example.com
## green.example.com
## 192.168.100.1
## 

# Secondly, I show collections of hosts belonging to the 'webservers' group

[webservers] ## Here we see our first example of our '[]' delimitor around our group
## alpha.example.org
## beta.example.org
## 192.168.1.100
## 192.168.1.110

## Below is the primary & secondary IP configuration for our Azure Network Interface
AzureUser@10.0.0.12 ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
AzureUser@10.0.0.9 ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
AzureUser@10.0.0.13 ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3

[elk] ## Network is as follows:
AzureUser@10.2.0.4 python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3


# Note to keep in mind that multiple hosts following a pattern should look like the following:

## www[001:006].example.com

# Lastly, our collection of database servers in our dbservers group
# Which again includes our '[]' delimination

## [dbservers]
## 10.25.1.56
## 10.25.1.57
## db01.intranet.mydomain.net
## db02.intranet.mydomain.net
## 
##

# A final example of host ranges minus the '00's in front of our range

## db-[95:115]-node.example.com
## END
